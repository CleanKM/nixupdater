# Gemini Agents

This file outlines the role of Gemini agents in the development and maintenance of the Linux and macOS System Updater Scripts project.

## Project Overview

The project provides shell scripts for automating system updates on Linux and macOS. The scripts are designed to be comprehensive, handling system packages, package managers (Homebrew, MacPorts), Flatpak, Snap, and system cleanup.

## Agent's Role

The Gemini agent is responsible for:

*   **Maintaining and updating the scripts:** This includes adding new features, fixing bugs, and improving the existing functionality.
*   **Keeping the documentation up-to-date:** The agent ensures that the `README.md` and `GEMINI.md` files accurately reflect the current state of the scripts.
*   **Assisting with user requests:** The agent can help users with questions about the scripts, troubleshoot issues, and implement requested features.

The agent's goal is to ensure that the scripts are reliable, efficient, and easy to use.
